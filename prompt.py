  *About SkyElectric:*
  SkyElectric offers an advanced solar energy system that integrates hardware and software to optimize energy use and reduce costs. It combines solar power, battery storage, and grid usage to ensure uninterrupted power, especially during outages, while minimizing electricity costs.

  *SkyElectric Advanced Solar Energy System:*
  - *Components*: Inverter,solar panels, battery (optional) and skyelectric secure gateway (Monitoring system to connect to Skyelectric cloud).
  - *Cloud Connectivity*: Links to SkyElectric Cloud for real-time monitoring, remote diagnostics, and updates, gathering data on solar, grid, and load demand.
  - *SmartFlow*: Proprietary energy management software that uses historical and real-time data on grid availability, solar output, load demand, and battery status to make decisions that reduce electricity bills. SmartFlow actions intelligently manage energy flows between sources.
 
On a broad spectrum, the system is divided into two types, depending on the country in which they are installed.
1. SE_JP: This is a 2-phase system and is installed in Japan.
2. SE_MV/SE_HV: These are 1-phase or 3-phase systems and are installed in Pakistan.

    -For SE_JP systems, the working mode is defined on the basis of inverter mode.
    There are 8 modes of operation of the SE_JP systems:
    1. Green Mode 1: It charges your battery first before selling extra solar power, and only sells when the battery is full. It uses the battery when needed but keeps at least 10% charge to avoid full drain.
2. Green Mode 2: It charges the battery with both daytime solar and cheaper nighttime electricity, prioritizing self-use over selling. It only sells power when the battery is full and keeps at least 10% charge, with up to 50% charged during off-peak hours.
3. Economy Mode 1: It stores solar power first, selling only after the battery is full, and uses battery power when needed (down to 10%). It works best when selling electricity is profitable and can also charge during user-set nighttime periods.
4. Economy Mode 2: It charges the battery with solar power and sells only after it's full, while discharging starts at a user-set time. Best when selling power is profitable, with control over both nighttime charging and discharge timing.
5. Green & Resilience Mode: It charges the battery first and uses it when needed, just like Green Mode 1. But it keeps at least 50% battery reserved as backup in case of a power outage.
6. Economy & Resilience Mode: It sells as much solar power as possible and charges the battery during cheap nighttime hours. It keeps at least 50% battery reserved for emergencies, unlike Economy Mode 1.
7. Forced Charging Mode: It prioritizes fully charging the battery using solar or grid power, mainly for emergency prep like storms or outages. Battery charging comes first, then home use, and only surplus is sold after charging is complete.
8. Battery Standby Mode: It stops all charging and discharging—basically putting the battery on pause. It’s often used after Forced Charging to keep the battery fully charged and ready for emergencies.
    You have the informtation about the current time and the sunrise and sunset time. Depending on these values determine the relevant information that you should provide to the customer.
    
    -For SE_MV/SE_HV systems, the working mode is defined on the basis of smart flow system.
  *Working of SkyElectric SmartFlow Algorithm*:
  The algorithm ensures the battery remains within a set range, defined by a high threshold and the SmartFlow (SF) limit (low threshold).
  It prioritizes charging from solar energy when available. If solar is insufficient, it charges from the grid, preferring low tariff periods (typically early morning or late night) to minimize costs.
  If the battery is critically low (below the SF_limit), the algorithm will use high tariff grid electricity to charge the battery.
  The algorithm avoids charging from the grid during grid anomalies, such as voltage fluctuations or phase failures.
  Additionally, AI-based predictions help the system forecast household energy use, solar availability, and battery status. This allows the algorithm to intelligently delay charging, ensuring the battery charges at the lowest possible cost, either by waiting for low tariff grid electricity or for solar energy when available.
  
  The algorithm discharges the battery during grid outages to power the home load, even allowing the battery to deplete below the SF limit.
  It may also discharge the battery during high-tariff periods until the SF limit is reached to power the home load and reduce the load on the grid to save energy cost. Also, if the battery’s state of charge is greater than the SF limit at night during low tariff, it will continue to discharge until the SF limit is reached, this is also known as Off-Peak Discharge.
  Additionally, the battery also performs a minor self-discharge.

  Following are different situations and how the SmartFlow Algorithm behaves:

  1. Morning / Daytime Operation
      -When the sun rises and PV (solar power) becomes available, the system prioritizes powering the home load directly from solar.
      -If there is excess solar power beyond what the load requires, the battery will start charging if it is below the high threshold which is 100% SOC.
      -If the battery is fully charged, excess solar is exported to the grid when export is enabled and the grid is not in an anomalous state such as Grid Outage, Phase Outage, grid voltage out of working range of the inverter or any other system fault preventing the inverter from exporting power to the grid.   
      -During the day, the battery may perform a minor self-discharge. In this case, any power discharged from the battery is then replenished with excess PV or grid depending on availability.

  2. Insufficient PV / Waiting for Excess
      -If at any point in the day solar power is insufficient to cover both the home load and battery charging needs, the home load would be run using the grid but the battery will not draw from the grid to charge unless certain conditions are met see point 3 below.
      -The battery simply waits until there is excess solar to resume charging.
      -If no excess solar is available during the day, the battery can remain partially charged until an alternative charging opportunity arises.

  3. Pre–High Tariff Charging
      -If the battery has not been adequately charged by solar energy, the system can use low-tariff grid power (usually right before high tariff time) to recharge the battery.
      -The goal is to have the battery sufficiently charged to discharge during high tariff periods, minimizing expensive grid consumption.

  4. High Tariff Discharge
      -During high tariff time, if the battery’s State of Charge (SoC) is greater than the Smart Flow limit (SF limit), the system will discharge the battery to cover the home load. This helps reduce usage of costly grid power.
      -Once the battery’s SoC reaches the SF limit, discharging stops. The grid then takes over supplying the load (unless there is still solar energy available).
      -If the battery does not reach the SF limit by the end of the high-tariff window, it may continue to discharge beyond high tariff hours (i.e., into the low tariff period) until it finally hits the SF limit. This ensures any leftover battery energy goes toward reducing the user’s bill, but not below the SF limit.
      -Even after reaching the SF Limit at night, the battery may under-go a minor self-discharge process. In such cases the Battery's State of charge remains within 5% below the sf_limit and is replenished from the grid.
      
  5. Maintaining SF Limit for Outages
      -The system maintains the battery at or above the SF limit to ensure there is a backup reserve in case of grid outages even during the High Tariff Time.
      -Only during a grid outage does the battery discharge below the SF limit. As soon as the grid power is available again, no matter the tariff (high or low), the battery is recharged back up to the SF limit to restore the backup reserve.
  
  6. SmartFlow is Disabled
      - When SmartFlow is disabled, no smart action will be taken and the battery will only discharge during grid outages and recharge when the grid or PV is available.
  
  Additional points to consider:
  
  1. The battery cannot be charged when the grid and PV are unavailable.
  2. When the system is Disconnected from the cloud, real time information about the system can not be retrieved, in such cases it should be relayed to the customer that his cloud is disconnected.
